# ProteinStreching
Matlab files for identifying unfolding/refolding events using optical tweezers

The repository contains files for reading experiment output files created by 
the miniTweezers instrument from TweezersLab (http://tweezerslab.unipr.it)
and extracting unfolding and refolding events when streching individual protein molecules.
